# UFOs
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create an interactive webpage using JavaScript and HTML tools. Through this challenge we were able to make tables to filter the data of UFO sightings to make the user achieve a certain input quicker and faster. We did this through learning and developing Javascript language to enable filters on the date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sighting. This enables users to find data easier than scrolling through the whole data document. We then coded some CSS to style the webpage by adding a dark theme and an image behind the main header. 
## Analysis
The webpage can be found at https://mckjack.github.io/UFOs/ 

We see from the webpage that the site looks like this,

You can navigate through the webpage and data by using the filters for the date, city, state, country and shape of the UFO. The user can either type one of these filters in or to be more exact on the search, type in using all 5 filters to filter a sighting that is more exact. Recommend that the user uses lowercase since from the data source that is the case used. Also for the country or state the abbreviation is used instead of the full name. 

## Summary 
There is one drawback from this template and that is if the user doesn't know the limits on the search meaning that only certain data was retrieved and the user may be stuck at a crossroad trying to search a city that is not in the data. Saying this, the two recommendations we suggest are a dropdown box to show all the states, countries, and cities in the data to make the search limited to the data making it easier for the user to filter the data and find a desired sighting. We also suggest a filter reset button to clear all the filters that were typed in to have make it clear for the user to begin another sighting search.
